    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Signup for an AWS account and redeem the credits from GA\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Imagine you are trying to explain to someone what Linear Regression is - but they have no programming/maths experience? How would you explain the overall process, what a p-value means and what R-Squared means?\n",
    "* Write a review of one Small Multiple project of your choice. Include a link, what you thought the purpose of the visualisation was and what you discovered as a result. Is there anything you would add to it or like to see?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "* Read chapters 3 and 6 of Introduction to Statistical Learning\n",
    "* Describe 3 ways we can select what features to use in a model\n",
    "* Complete the first 3 exercises from chapter 3 in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Draft/Sketch on paper (or wireframe) some data visualisations that would be useful for you to explore your data set\n",
    "* Is there any regresion techniques you could use in your project? Write them down and what you think you would get out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework2_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"

    "* Linear regression is the process of fitting a straight line to a set of data points to capture the trend. \n",
    "* The fitting is done in such as way that the total overall error or the distance between the line and the data points is minimised.\n",
    "* P-value in linear regression analysis refers to how certain the effect of a particular feature or variable is. The smaller the p-value, the more confident that we are there is an effect between a certain predictor and the response (not due to chance).\n",
    "* R-squared in linear regression measures what proportion of the variation in the response variable is explain by your model."

    "#### Backward Selection\n",

    "#### Mixed Selection\n",
    "We start with a null model and add to it one feature at a time just like forward selection. However, we have a p-value threshold in mind and will subtract features that have p-value greater than this threshold as they are added to the model."

Whereas TV and radio have statistically significant effect where every 1000 dollars increase in TV and radio adversting would increase sales by 46 and 189 units respectively."

    "<li> For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough. This is because the interaction term between GPA and Gender is significantly negative. Even though the Gender variable being female is positively associated with the salary response, it is offset by this interaction term when GPA is high. </li>\n",

    "<li> False. The magnitude of effect of a particular coefficient term on the response depends on the scale of the predictors it relates to. We need to multiply the coefficient by the magnitude of the predictor to calculate the effect on the response variable. In this case it's relatively small as the predictor IQ x GPA will be on the scale of few hundreds, which when multiplied by its coefficient 0.01 is in single digits. </li>\n",
