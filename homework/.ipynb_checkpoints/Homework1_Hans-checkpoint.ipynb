    "> Great work Hans!!! I really like the layout, very clear and well communicated. Excellent writeups and well written code. Keep up the good work!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_3\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"

    "* You have to position yourself so that other people willing to take risk on you, before they can give you the opportunity to work for them. And to do that, you must have failed many times and learnt through iterations to figure out how the business world works.\n",
    "* You have to be able to make things and tell a story about why you made it. You have to colloborate with others and engage in the business world.\n",
    "* Data science is a team sport. Someone has to bring the data together, someone has to move it, someone needs to analyze it and someone needs to communicate the insights.\n",
    "* The millenial generation is much more mission-driven and problem-solving. They feel accomplished when they've helped out others. Their focus is compassion instead of empathy. It's a shift from being able to see trends in data to actioning on insights from data.\n",
    "* Because the world is ever changing at a faster rate than before, people need to prepare themselves with a dynamic range of skills and two strong suits. \n",
    "* The ability to make, storytell and create narratives. Never lose the feeling of passion and curiosity.\n",

    "* In five years time, data science will be more specialized as we're already beginning to see Master's degree program for data science. Tooling is already beginning to get better. Data culture will continue to grow with basic knowledge of statistics and databases embedded in general education.\n",
    "* A data scientist is someone who sit down with a questions and try to gather data to answer it. Or they start with a data set and come up with valuable questions to learn about the data. They do some maths, write some code and undergo some analysis to communicate their findings to non-technical people through creating a compelling story supported by the underlying data.\n",
    "* It's not easy to communicate the results because you have to have empathy to put yourself in the shoes of those with a different background to yourself. You also have to cater for their short attention span and impatient through tools of visualizations. \n",
    "* Compared to companies that have no incentives to share their data and have data in highly controlled environments and different silos, startups are the perfect place where you have a product that's generating its own data.\n",
    "* Look for good data sets in coming up with creative ideas to solve problems.\n",
    "* Three questions to ask in any data science project include\n",
    "    1. Can we proper define the question we're interested in in plain langauge?\n",
    "    2. How do we know when we're succesful? What are the error metrics by which we evaluatge solutions to this question?\n",
    "    3. Assuming we can solve this problem perfectly, what's the first thing we will do with it to impact the business?\n",
    "* The first things you can do when hiring is to look for people who learn quickly, are really creative and flexible in that they can collaborate with multiple teams ranging from engineering to data infrastructure to product and business.\n",
    "* It's important to work in an environment with challenging work with people you can learn from.\n",
    "* In general, I divide the work of a data scientist into three buckets: Stats, Code, and Storytelling/Visualization.Try to do a project that plays to your strengths and do a project using whichever area you're worst at. \n",

    "### 1. Car Telematics\n",
    "* The idea here is to group user together in terms of their driving behaviours to arrive at driving profiles that better distinguishes safer drivers from risky ones. \n",
    "* The data will be publicly available on Kaggle webiste under [AXA Driver Telematics Analyis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis).\n",
    "* The outcome we're trying to achieve is to accurately and identify cluster driver behaviours.\n",

    "* The idea is to predict the user's broad behaviours from sensor information from their smartphones.\n",
    "* The data will be publicly available on UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "* The outcome is to accurately predict what the user is doing eg. standing, sitting, lying, walking, etc from a vast array of sensor measurements.\n",
    "* Classification problem, may need to use clustering \n",

    "> Interesting, what would the application of the outcome be? I can see there being a few really useful use cases for this analysis and you can guide it into a fw different directions.\n",

    "* The idea is to predict the time and end point of taxi rides given the initial portion so taxi companies can better plan for demands.\n",

    "* The data will be publicly avaialable on Kaggle webiste under [Allstate Claim Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ClaimPredictionChallenge)\n",
